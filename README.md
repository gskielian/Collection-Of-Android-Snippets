# Collection-Of-Android-Snippets
Will be compiling the useful android snippets here -- feel free to pull request! : D


## Suggested Read Through Order:

1. Buttons
2. Intents - snippets for Button actions
3. Animations - snippets for Button actions
3. Action Bar items - top bar buttons
4. Threading (keeping up responsiveness by doing work on separate threads)

## Example:
